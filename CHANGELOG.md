## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `tests/test_pe/test_critical_anchors.py`: SageMath regression anchors that
  re-prove the audit's critical fixes on discriminating geometries — round S³
  (Fefferman–Graham `g₄=1/16 g₀` (C1), renormalized volume `v₂=−3/4` (C2),
  `Q₄=15/8`) and the non-Einstein product S²(1)×S²(2) (Schouten 7/24, −1/3;
  `J=5/12`; conformal Laplacian `P₂(1)=−5/12` isolating the curvature term (M2);
  `Bach≠0`). These run in the existing Track A SageMath CI. (167 tests total.)

### Fixed
- Symbolic curvature operators (`P₂`, Paneitz `P₄`, `Q₄`) formed rational
  coefficients via Python float division on `cs.dimension` (a Python int),
  contaminating results with floats (masked when the exact value is
  binary-representable). Reordered so a Sage object is divided by the integer
  denominator, keeping outputs exact (e.g. `P₂(1)=−5/12`, not `−0.41666…`).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed (mathematical correctness audit)
Independent adversarial re-audit of every quantitative claim; full record in
[ERRATA.md](ERRATA.md). Highlights:
- **Critical:** corrected Fefferman–Graham `g₄` (spurious `1/(n−4)` on the
  algebraic term; `n=4` trace coefficient `⅛ → 1/16`) and renormalized-volume
  `v₂` (`−1/(n−2)J → −½J`, and the `n=2` sign). (`C1`, `C2`, `M11`, `M12`)
- **Major:** the conformal Laplacian `P₂` now includes its curvature term
  `−(n−2)/(4(n−1))R` (was the bare Laplacian); the `n=3` holographic stress
  tensor is now actually traceless; the discrete Bach proxy uses the
  mass-inverse `M⁻¹L M⁻¹L` bi-Laplacian; removed a false discrete `Q₄` identity;
  relabeled discrete `H²−K` as the Willmore integrand (not 4D GJMS `Q₄`);
  corrected the `P₆`/README `−Δ³ → +Δ³` sign. (`M2`, `M3`, `M13`–`M17`)
- **Documented honestly (incomplete math flagged in-code, open for
  contribution):** extrinsic `Q₄`/`P₂` (`M4`, `M8`), `L₂` Fialkow terms (`M7`),
  weight-4 invariant under-count (`M5`, `M6`), Carroll connection scope and
  symmetry predicate (`M9`, `M10`).
- **Minor/style:** tractor `μ`-slot weight label `+1`; `bach()` `1/(n−3)`
  docstring; `is_valid` rank check; removed dead/incorrect symmetrization line;
  `Q₂` normalization caveat. (`m1`–`m6`, `s1`)
- Added [ERRATA.md](ERRATA.md), [docs/TOOLING_GAPS.md](docs/TOOLING_GAPS.md), and
  README "Verify it yourself" / "Contributing corrections" sections.
